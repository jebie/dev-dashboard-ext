# Personal Dashboard & TODO Chrome Extension

Transform your new tab into a personal dashboard that keeps you focused on your priorities. Every time you open a new tab, you'll be reminded of your current tasks and their status, ensuring nothing important slips through the cracks.

## About This Project

This project was primarily developed using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), an AI-powered code editor. As the project supervisor, I provided the requirements, feature specifications, and guidance while Cursor generated much of the implementation code. My role involved:

- Defining the core functionality and user experience
- Specifying the required features and UI components
- Reviewing and refining AI-generated code
- Testing and debugging the implementation
- Ensuring code quality and best practices

This collaborative approach between human supervision and AI assistance resulted in a robust Chrome extension that effectively manages tasks while maintaining clean, maintainable code.
